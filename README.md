-Start by pasting all photos(pybrick1,pybrick2,...) in the python program folder.

-Connect to the ev3dev robot

-Load the python program on the robot and run it.


##Building and running

-When the program is running it will request for a set of inputs, made by buttons.

-The screen will show a request alogside the options to chose between, like a menu.

##Features

[x] US01B: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items from a designated position

[x] US02B: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at a designated position.

[x] US03: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to determine if an item is present at a given location.

[x] US04B: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item at a designated position.

[x] US05: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item.

[x] US06: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to pick up items from elevated positions.

[x] US08B As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items off at specific drop-off zones based on color.


[x] US09: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has arrived.

[x] US10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time.

[x] US11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other.

[x] US12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons)
